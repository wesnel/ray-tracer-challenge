  This book is the primary focus of this project.  It explains how to
  create a ray tracer from scratch, and it does so by using [[https://cucumber.io/][Cucumber]]
  tests to fully specify each behavior, including edge cases.  In this
  repository, all of my Cucumber tests are more or less copied from
  the book, and I parse and execute them using [[https://github.com/cucumber/godog][godog]].

  However, since I am using a programming language with static types,
  I felt that I was able to make a diversion from the book early on:
  instead of treating vectors and points as variations of a
  four-dimensional "tuple" with either 0 or 1 (respectively) in the
  fourth component, I instead ignore this fourth component and rely on
  the static type system to tell me whether a value is a point or a
  vector.  This choice leads to some major changes in the early tests
  from the book.

  This book contains some more advanced and optimized approaches to
  the mathematics used in the ray tracer.  I have replaced some of the
  algorithm implementations described in /The Ray Tracer Challenge/ with
  some alternatives from /Foundations of Game Engine Development/
  instead.  In particular, since this ray tracer deals with
  [[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates][homogeneous coordinates]], we are able to use an optimized approach to
  find the inverse of matrices of this specific form.
